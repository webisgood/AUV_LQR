# Position and Velocity Control of a six-thruster AUV

In this project we modeled an AUV in Simulink in the form of a Block Diagram and State-Space Model. The former was used to implement a PID controller for the linear and non-linear models of the AUV while the state-space model was crucial in the design of the novel LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller for controlling the AUV.
We also tested the robustness of these two controllers and enlisted the results in a report which can be found at: [MCS Project Group1 Final Report.pdf](https://github.com/webisgood/AUV_LQR/blob/master/MCS%20Project%20Group1%20Final%20Report.pdf)
